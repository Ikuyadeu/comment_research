2,1000012,Looks good, but I am not an approver, yet.
4,1000011,To me as someone who doesnt know anything, it looks sensible.

32,1000020,Im not sure whether adding a member in IFile just because of that is a good approach. This highlight info bar is only used by the plain text editor and if the user has this option set. This is probably a significant minority (if any) of all IFile instances around a given moment.I would suggest a more scalable solution in which IFile is able to *identify* the active info bars and in the case of a request for a duplicate bar it could simply ignore it (the API could make that clear).
32,1000020,I would still prefer my previous suggestion... But if you go for this bool member approach Im ok if its added to the PlainTextEditorWidget itself, since its the only editor to which this warning message exists and make sense (and it already has other members related to this like, for example, m_isMissingSyntaxDefinition).

37,1000012,I removed the AllPropertiesBox from the very old integration.I will continue to clean up DesignDocumentController
37,1000003,See inline comments.
52,1000026,Can you fix the issues first?

70,1000003,Looked into the QmlProject parts ... It breaks qmldump where your run configuration isnt a QmlProject one, but the old logic (just find any Qt with qmldump) was dubious at best anyway.
70,1000004,technically, the restoreFromLegacyConfig and toolForFoo changes should be separate commits, afaict.alternatively, the commit message should elaborate on them at least.as noted in change 65, i think the move of the proparser to utils makes no sense in the face of this change - you can export it from qtsupport just as well, and it fits better here.
74,1000020,This feature is of great value. My initial comments concern usability in general.The code style widget looks great and intuitive. But I think the tab settings concept is now a bit confusing due to the many fallbacks (global editor, project editor, global C++, project C++) available. I was wondering how much of those Tabs and Indentation settings are really used by other language editors...?The point is that maybe we should keep only the tab-size and replace for space options as part of the text editor. After all, indentation and related are really language specific and could be handle in the specific language options (C++, QML, etc). This could help making things clearer (in fact, we have a similar situation for completion).Now, since we have a lot of settings, I believe we should have a way of identifying configurations, importing/exporting, or at least resetting to a original state... I could make use of this one right now actually. :-)Something picky: The combos in the Tabs and Identation section should be in the same line after the colon in my option.
