  32, 1,1000020, Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didnt submit this  Im not sure whether adding a member in IFile just because of that is a good approach. This highlight info bar is only used by the plain text editor and if the user has this option set. This is probably a significant minority (if any) of all IFile instances around a given moment.  I would suggest a more scalable solution in which IFile is able to *identify* the active info bars and in the case of a request for a duplicate bar it could simply ignore it (the API could make that clear). ,-1, merged

  32, 3,1000020, Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didnt submit this  I would still prefer my previous suggestion... But if you go for this bool member approach Im ok if its added to the PlainTextEditorWidget itself, since its the only editor to which this warning message exists and make sense (and it already has other members related to this like, for example, m_isMissingSyntaxDefinition). ,-1, merged
  32, 4,1000020, Patch Set 3: Looks good to me, approved  Ok, I would still prefer the previous suggestion... But I think its ok to keep this for now. We should keep it in mind to improve the info bar. ,+1, merged

  74, 2,1000020, Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve  This feature is of great value. My initial comments concern usability in general.  The code style widget looks great and intuitive. But I think the tab settings concept is now a bit confusing due to the many fallbacks (global editor, project editor, global C++, project C++) available. I was wondering how much of those Tabs and Indentation settings are really used by other language editors...?  The point is that maybe we should keep only the tab-size and replace for space options as part of the text editor. After all, indentation and related are really language specific and could be handle in the specific language options (C++, QML, etc). This could help making things clearer (in fact, we have a similar situation for completion).  Now, since we have a lot of settings, I believe we should have a way of identifying configurations, importing/exporting, or at least resetting to a original state... I could make use of this one right now actually. :-)  Something picky: The combos in the Tabs and Identation section should be in the same line after the colon in my option. ,+1, merged

  97, 1,1000014, Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved  I cannot really test this, closest I get is running MinGW32 on Vista64 and that results in:  0 ntdll!RtlDosPathNameToRelativeNtPathName_U_WithStatus	C: Windows system32 ntdll.dll 0 0x77870005	 1 ntdll!LdrInitializeThunk C: Windows system32 ntdll.dll 0x778cd990 2 ?? 0 0x623d0c90  that is, despite being a 32bit process, it reports a stop in the WOW32 emulation, so, the patch does not have any effect/is not required. A test on Windows32 should give meaningful results. ,+1, merged
